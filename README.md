# Rapid classification of amorphous-crystalline phase using artificial neural networks and resistivity mapping

In this repository, the running scripts to reproduce the models described in the article entitled of "Electrical Resistivity as a Descriptor for Classification of Amorphous-Crystalline Phases of Alloys," authored by Daegun You, Haitao Zhang, Shraddha Ganorkar, Taeyeop Kim, Jan Schroers, Joost J. Vlassak, and Dongwoo Lee.

## Implementation

The scripts in this repository can be reproducible via two methods.

1. Install software and all modules in your local drive.

Download scripts and data to run.

2. Use Google Colab. Two models are linked via the followings:
