# Rapid classification of amorphous-crystalline phase using artificial neural networks and resistivity mapping

In this repository, the running scripts to reproduce the models described in the article entitled of "Electrical Resistivity as a Descriptor for Classification of Amorphous-Crystalline Phases of Alloys," authored by Daegun You, Haitao Zhang, Shraddha Ganorkar, Taeyeop Kim, Jan Schroers, Joost J. Vlassak, and Dongwoo Lee.

## Implementation

The scripts in this repository can be reproducible via two methods.

1. Install software and all modules in your local drive. Then download scripts and data to run. <br/> 
You may first need to install [numpy](https://numpy.org/install/), [keras](https://keras.io/getting_started/), and [mat4py](https://pypi.org/project/mat4py/) (to read .mat format) modules in your local machine.

2. Use Google Colab. Two models are linked via the followings: <br/> [HTE only - with 3features](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1oS4rQTOYKA3RHbJ86EFaLC4JNRpjvDSa?usp=sharing) <br/> [HTE+Literature - with 4features](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1guedrm8got1pI_UJ0MoQko07D6mJ4oQx?usp=sharing)
