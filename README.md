# Rapid classification of amorphous-crystalline phase using artificial neural networks and resistivity mapping

In this repository, the running scripts to reproduce the models described in the article entitled of "Electrical Resistivity as a Descriptor for Classification of Amorphous-Crystalline Phases of Alloys," authored by Daegun You, Haitao Zhang, Shraddha Ganorkar, Taeyeop Kim, Jan Schroers, Joost J. Vlassak, and Dongwoo Lee.

## Implementation

The scripts in this repository can be reproducible via two methods.

1. Install software and all modules in your local drive.
   Download scripts and data to run.

2. Colab
